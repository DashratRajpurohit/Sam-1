    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The journey began with the <b>abacus</b> and later
        <u>Babbages Analytical Engine</u>, seen as the
        <strong>first computer idea</strong>.
        <em>Ada Lovelace</em> wrote the first algorithm.
        Machines moved from <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>
        to <i>transistors</i>. Equations like E = mc<sup>2</sup>
        and H<sub>2</sub>O shaped scientific computing.

    <h2>Generations</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>
        evolved across generations. From <del>dial-up</del>
        to <ins>broadband</ins>, computers became <small>smaller</small>
        and faster. Programmers use <code>for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)</code>,
        while pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies text
        (<samp>Copied!</samp>). Algorithms often use
        <var>n</var><sup>2</sup> growth.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>
        by Tim Berners-Lee changed history with
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
        He said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“The power of the Web is in its universality.”
        — <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite></blockquote>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>Today, we use <b>smartphones</b>, <em>AI</em>,
        and global networks. Security is <ins>prioritized</ins>.
        Technology continues to <mark>shape society</mark> worldwide.</p>
