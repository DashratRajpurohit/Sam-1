        The first introduction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund">mutual fund</a> in <a href="">
            India</a> occurred in 1963,
        when <a href="">the Governmentb of India</a> <br> launched the <a href="">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI).
        <a href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Mutual funds are broadly categorised <br>into three segments: <a href="">equity
            funds,</a> hybrid funds, and <a href="">debt funds</a>.

            <li>The total <a href=""> Assets Under Management</a> (AUM) of the Indian
                mutual fund industry as of December 31, 2023, stood at a
                staggering <a href="">&#8377;</a>50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant
                milestone, marking over a six-fold increase compared to the
                <a href="">&#8377;</a>8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December 2013. <a

                According to <a href="">SEBI</a>, during FY 2022–23, 73% of <a href="">mutual fund</a>
                units were redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only
                investments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5
                years. <sup><a href="">[3][4]</a></sup>

                According to the <a href="">Reserve Bank of India</a> report, mutual funds attracted 6% of household
                savings
                in FY2023 and
                less than <br>
                1% went into direct equities. <sup><a href="">[5][6][7]</a></sup> Almost 95% of household savings in
                India
                park their money in bank
                deposits, including <a href="">fixed deposit, provident fund, PPF, life insurance</a>, and various small

                According to the S&P SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximate 68% of the large-cap
                actively
                managed <br>
                funds failed to beat their respective benchmarks, and over 50% failed to beat their benchmarks in the

                In April 2020, <a href="#top">Franklin Templeton</a> India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to
                $4
                billion, citing a lack of
                <a href="#top">liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic</a>. These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated
                credit securities.<a href="#top">The Securities
                and Exchange Board of India</a>  (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses
                and
                violations”. As a result, in
                June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years.
                The
                regulator also ordered the
                fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees,
                and
                fined the global giant another
                50 million rupees.<a href="#top">[15][16][17][18]</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI's order and planned to appeal against it.
                The
                decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”,
                a
                spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin
                Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media
                and
                court cases by distraught investors.<a href="#top">[18][15][17]</a>

                troubled

            <p>
                The <a href="#top">IL&FS</a> crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed
                by
                IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt
                obligations
                and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and
                led
                to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting
                in
                losses to investors.<a href="#top">[21][22][23]</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making
                it
                difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This
                event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other
                non-banking
                financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
                securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market
                confidence.<a href="#top">[24][25][26][27]</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and
                infrastructure
                debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and
                more
                liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
                stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted
                in
                debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets
                and
                improved risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and
                liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the

                The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund
                industry. DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to
                meet
                redemption pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant
                concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial
                companies
                (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values
                (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities.<a href="#top">[32][33][34][35]</a>

            <p>
                Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was
                severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response,
                the
                Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on
                mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund
                managers
                adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure
                to
                high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity
                management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within the mutual fund

                The<a href="#top"> Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI) faced a significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale
                redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was
                exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual
                funds,
                including UTI's schemes, suffering severe consequences.<a href="#top">[36][37][38]</a>

            <p>
                The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the
                bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI
                Trustee
                Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the

                prompting
                the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several
                mutual
                funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark
