    The first introduction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund">mutual fund</a> in <a href="">
        India</a> occurred in 1963,
    when <a href="">the Governmentb of India</a> <br> launched the <a href="">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI).
    <a href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Mutual funds are broadly categorised <br>into three segments: <a href="">equity
        funds,</a> hybrid funds, and <a href="">debt funds</a>.

            staggering <a href="">&#8377;</a>50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant
            milestone, marking over a six-fold increase compared to the

            According to <a href="">SEBI</a>, during FY 2022–23, 73% of <a href="">mutual fund</a>
            units were redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only

            According to the <a href="">Reserve Bank of India</a> report, mutual funds attracted 6% of household savings

        <p><b>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco <sub><a href="">[edit]</a></sub></b></p>
        <p>
            In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4
            billion, citing a lack of
            liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated
            credit securities. The Securities
            and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and
            violations”. As a result, in
            June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The
            regulator also ordered the
            fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and
            fined the global giant another
            50 million rupees.[15][16][17][18]
        </p>

        <p>
            Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI's order and planned to appeal against it. The
            decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a
            spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin
            Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and
            court cases by distraught investors.[18][15][17]

        <p>
            In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled
            companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset
            sales, which significantly affected investors.[19][20]

        <p><b>IL&FS crisis and impact <sub><a href="">[edit]</a></sub></b></p>
        <p>
            The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by
            IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations
            and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led
            to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in
            losses to investors.[21][22][23]
        </p>

        <p>
            The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
            difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This
            event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking
            financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
            securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market
            confidence.[24][25][26][27]
        </p>

        <p>
            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure
            debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more
            liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
            stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in
            debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and
            improved risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and
            liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual
            fund industry.[24][25][26][27]

            Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues
            due to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and
            impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis.[28][29][30]

            The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund
            industry. DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet
            redemption pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant
            concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies
            (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values
            (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities.[32][33][34][35]
        </p>
        <p>
            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was
            severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response, the
            Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on
            mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund managers
            adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to
            high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity
            management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within the mutual fund
            industry.[32][33][34][35]

        <p><b>2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco<sub><a href="">[edit]</a></sub></b></p>
        <p>
            The Unit Trust of India (UTI) faced a significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale
            redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was
            exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,
            including UTI's schemes, suffering severe consequences.[36][37][38]
        </p>
        <p>
            The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the
            bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI Trustee
            Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the
            assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s intervention included a bailout package to
            stabilize the situation and ensure the protection of investors’ interests.[36][37][38]

        <p>
            Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led
            to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations, prompting
            the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual
            funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down
            the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities.[39][40][32][35]
        </p>
        <p>
            The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure
            of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in
            the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund,
            which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the
            exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments.[39][40][32][35]
